## Overview

This project is a user-facing instructional guide built with MkDocs and the Material theme. It walks readers through three moderately complex but practical Google Sheets tasks:

1. Building a budget tracker with automatic totals and charts
2. Creating a to-do list with conditional formatting
3. Merging contributor spreadsheets into a live, searchable resource index

Each task is broken into clear, step-by-step instructions and supported with annotated GIFs that demonstrate each action.

## Tools Used

- **Google Sheets** – Platform for all spreadsheet tasks
- **MkDocs** – Static site generator for documentation
- **Material for MkDocs** – Theme for visual clarity and structure
- **peek** – For creating GIFs of spreadsheet interactions
- **Markdown** – For writing all content
