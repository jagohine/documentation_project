# Welcome

This site is a practical tutorial on how to perform three useful tasks in Google Sheets. Each task walks you through a short, self-contained project. You’ll learn how to build a personal budget tracker, a conditional to-do list, and a shared resource index that updates live from multiple contributors.

- **Menu items** and interface labels are written in `code style`, such as `Data > Data validation`.
- **Formulas** are always shown in preformatted blocks like this:
  ```excel
  =SUM(D2:D)
  ```
- **GIFs** demonstrate each step visually.
- **Admonitions** are used to highlight specific types of content:

!!! tip
      A tip admonition like this offers helpful or optional guidance.

!!! warning
      A warning admonition like this alerts the reader to a possible difficulty or common mistake.

!!! note
      Notes like this explain something important that doesn’t fit in the main instruction line.
